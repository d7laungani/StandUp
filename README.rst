Technology has made it all too easy for us to spend our lives moving from our car seat to office chair, back to car seat, and then to the couch. With our jobs and commutes, it may seem impossible to switch to an active lifestyle, even if itâ€™s healthier. Why should it be ?

Stand Up is a quick and easy way to solve the problem by allowing you to set reminders for standing up. This is especially useful for situations where you plan on sitting down for prolonged periods of time and don't have the option, or don't wish to stand up all the time like at work so it has a dual purpose as a work break timer as well.
